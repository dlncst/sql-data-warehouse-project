# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository  
This project showcases the approach to building a data warehouse and analytics solution using SQL. 
Designed as a portfolio project, it emphasizes industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.


## Data Architecture

**Bronze Layer:** This foundational layer stores raw data directly from source systems. In this project, data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server Database, ensuring that the original data remains unaltered for future reference.​  
**Silver Layer:** At this stage, the project focuses on data cleansing, standardization, and normalization. These processes prepare the data for more efficient analysis by ensuring consistency and reliability.  
**Gold Layer:** The final layer contains business-ready data, meticulously modeled into a star schema. This structure is optimized for reporting and analytics, facilitating swift and insightful data retrieva

## Project Overview
The repository provides a detailed walkthrough of the entire process, from the initial data ingestion to the generation of actionable insights. As a portfolio project, it not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also aligns with industry standards in data warehousing and analytics.​

Repository Structure:

datasets/: Contains the raw CSV files used for data ingestion.​

scripts/: Includes SQL scripts for creating tables, performing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, and implementing data transformations across the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.​

tests/: Houses test cases to validate data integrity and the accuracy of transformations, ensuring that each stage of the data pipeline functions as intended.​

LICENSE: Specifies the MIT license under which the project is distributed, allowing for open use and modification.​

README.md: Offers an overview of the project, detailing its purpose, architecture, and instructions for replication or further development.​

Key Highlights:

ETL Processes: The project meticulously outlines the ETL processes, ensuring that data is accurately extracted from sources, transformed according to business rules, and loaded into the appropriate layers of the data warehouse.​

Data Modeling: Emphasizes the creation of a star schema in the Gold Layer, optimizing data for analytical querying and reporting.​

Analytics: Demonstrates how the structured data can be utilized to derive meaningful business insights, showcasing the practical applications of the data warehouse.
